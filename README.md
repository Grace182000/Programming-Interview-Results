# Programming-Interview-Results
This is the programme answers about the Q1-3 questions , from Ruisi Geng.


**Even though I am in the very stressful final phase of my senior year during this impressive experience, I read these three questions carefully based on the theoretical foundation I already have, and even though this opportunity has shown me that I still have a lot to learn in the field of Bioinformatics, I am looking forward to it because I am motivated by interest in all my tasks.**

In the first task, I used the source code from @zhengyima and @onermustafaumit as a reference. In task 2, I tried to construct a function implementation through the Runge Kutta method implementation.
