# Programming-Interview-Results
This is the programme answers about the Q1-3 questions , from Ruisi Geng.

**Even though I am in a very stressful final phase of my senior year during this ddl, I read these three questions carefully based on the theoretical foundation I already have, and even though this opportunity has shown me that I still have a lot to learn in the field of Bioinformatics, I am looking forward to it, because I am motivated by interest in all my tasks.**

In the first task, I use the source code from *@zhengyima* and *onermustafaumit* as a reference. In the task 2, I tried to construct a function implementation through Runge Kutta method implementation.
